# Bank tech test

Today, you'll practice doing a tech test.

For most tech tests, you'll essentially have unlimited time.  This practice session is about producing the best code you can when there is a minimal time pressure.

You'll get to practice your OO design and TDD skills.

You'll work alone, and you'll also review your own code so you can practice reflecting on and improving your own work.

## Specification

### Requirements

* You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or Node.  (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
* Deposits, withdrawal.
* Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
* Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

### Acceptance criteria

**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2023  
**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2023  
**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2023  
**When** she prints her bank statement  
**Then** she would see

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2023 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2023 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2023 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```

## Self-assessment

Once you have completed the challenge and feel happy with your solution, here's a form to help you reflect on the quality of your code: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Q-NnqVObbGLDHxlvbUfeAC7yBCf3eCjTmz6GOqC9Aeo/edit

## Set Up locally

# Setting up a JavaScript project w/ Jest

Learn to set up a new JavaScript project with NPM and Jest.

## Concise guidance

We use NPM (Node package manager) to setup and manage a JavaScript project, and its dependencies (libraries or packages).

This guidance assumes you have NVM (the Node version manager) installed - if not, head to [this page](../bites/01_running_javascript.md) to install it first.

```bash

# Go to your terminal, and head to where you would like to store your repository.

#Copy and past this repository. In your terminal:

$ git clone [insert repo address]

# Setup our environment to use node latest version
$ nvm use node

# Initialise the NPM project (this will create a file package.json)
$ npm init -y

# Add the jest package to our project
# (this will update package.json and package-lock.json)
$ npm add jest

# Also install jest "globally"
# (this is so we can run the `jest` command)
$ npm install -g jest

# Run our tests //should dail is there are no tests written
$ jest 

OR

$ jest --passWithNoTests
```
